# LightThief Code

## Overview
This repository hosts the GNURadio flowgraph and MATLAB code related to the "LightThief" research, demonstrating methods to capture and analyze signal strength, and decode signals using USRP and MATLAB.

## Contents
- **Signal Capture**: Code for using USRP to collect signals.
- **Signal Processing**: MATLAB scripts for processing and analyzing the signal strength.
- **Decoding Algorithms**: Implementation of algorithms to decode the captured signals.

## Getting Started
- Ensure you have MATLAB and USRP hardware/software setup.
- Clone the repository and follow the instructions in each script for execution details.

## Usage
- Use the USRP code to collect signals under different conditions.
- Process these signals with the MATLAB scripts to analyze signal strength and perform decoding.
